👋 Hi, I’m @RealNugetka

👀 I’m interested in programming, anime, and Japanese culture.

🌱 I’m currently learning programming, Japanese, and working on creating my own anime collection.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programming projects and anime-related content.

📫 How to reach me: DM me on [platform of choice] or email at [your email].
